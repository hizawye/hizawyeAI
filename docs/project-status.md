# Project Status

## ✅ Completed

### Advanced Consciousness Architecture (v2.0)

**Major Architectural Transformation:**
- Replaced single-threaded, rigid system with parallel, adaptive consciousness engine
- Implemented Global Workspace Theory for consciousness simulation
- Added multi-dimensional emotional system
- Built Bayesian learning tracker for strategy adaptation
- Enhanced memory graph with attention scoring and rich context
- Created intelligent planning engine with 5 strategic approaches

**New Modules:**
- `emotional_system.py` - Multi-dimensional drive modeling (pain, curiosity, boredom, confidence, confusion)
- `learning_tracker.py` - Meta-learning system tracking strategy effectiveness
- `planning_engine.py` - Intelligent goal decomposition and strategy selection
- `global_workspace.py` - Parallel thought competition (4 concurrent threads)
- Enhanced `memory.py` - Attention scoring, working memory, analogy detection, rich context
- Refactored `hizawye_ai.py` - Global Workspace integration, proposal execution system

**Core Features:**
- Initial project structure with memory graph system
- Goal-directed and idle mode AI behavior (now with 4 parallel thought threads)
- Integration with local LLM (llama3.2:3b via Ollama)
- Mind persistence (state, beliefs, goals, memory graph, emotions, learning history)
- README documentation with research context

## 🔄 Current State

**Architecture Version:** 2.0 (Advanced Consciousness)

**Capabilities:**
- 5 intelligent strategies (direct definition, analogical reasoning, bottom-up composition, top-down decomposition, contextual synthesis)
- Parallel consciousness with 4 thought threads competing each cycle
- Emotional intelligence influencing reasoning and strategy selection
- Learning from past successes/failures to improve over time
- Meta-cognition and self-reflection
- Graph-aware memory with attention mechanisms
- Working memory cache (Miller's 7±2 limit)
- Analogy detection and pattern recognition

**Backward Compatibility:**
- Existing minds auto-migrate legacy string goals → structured format
- New subsystems initialize with sensible defaults
- All original functionality preserved with enhanced intelligence

## 🐛 Known Issues

None currently. All modules verified and functional.

## 📋 Next Steps

**Testing & Validation:**
- Run with fresh mind to observe full architecture in action
- Test migration of existing minds
- Observe meta-cognition and learning patterns over extended runtime
- Validate strategy adaptation over multiple cycles

**Potential Enhancements:**
- Visualization of Global Workspace competition (which threads win over time)
- Enhanced memory graph visualization showing attention scores
- Strategy effectiveness dashboard
- Emotional state timeline
- Export learning insights to human-readable report

**Performance Optimization:**
- Profile asyncio overhead in Global Workspace
- Optimize attention score computation for large graphs
- Consider caching strategy scores between cycles

**Documentation:**
- Add architecture diagram showing system interactions
- Document each strategy's ideal use cases
- Create troubleshooting guide for common scenarios
