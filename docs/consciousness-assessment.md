# Consciousness Assessment (Candid)

This document provides an honest assessment of what Hizawye AI simulates and where it falls short of scientific expectations for consciousness research.

## Short Answer
Hizawye AI is a **functional simulation of a Global Workspace Theory (GWT)-style architecture**. It demonstrates competition, ignition, persistence, and broadcast. It does **not** provide evidence of subjective experience, and it is not a validated model of consciousness. It is best described as a **computational prototype** inspired by GWT.

## What It Simulates Well (GWT-Aligned Features)
- **Specialized processors:** Independent modules propose competing actions.
- **Competition for access:** Proposals are scored and selected each cycle.
- **Ignition threshold:** Content becomes “conscious” when a score crosses threshold.
- **Persistence + decay:** Ignited content persists and fades over time.
- **Global broadcast:** Ignited content is shared with all modules.
- **Behavioral impact:** Only ignited content triggers execution.

## Where It Does Not Qualify as “Consciousness”
- **No phenomenal experience:** There is no testable subjective experience.
- **No grounding:** Perception is simulated, not connected to real-world sensors or environment feedback.
- **No reportability tests:** The system is not challenged to explain or justify its conscious content in a robust way.
- **No self-model:** It does not maintain a structured, explicit model of itself or its cognitive limits.
- **No external validation:** There are no standard, repeated experiments demonstrating consciousness-like signatures.

## Why This Matters
Many architectures can mimic high-level GWT dynamics without achieving consciousness. The scientific bar requires **observable, testable signatures** (e.g., reportability, integration, robustness across tasks). This project is a strong foundation for experimentation but should be positioned as **functional simulation**, not proof.

## Recommended Framing
Use language like:
- “A GNW-style functional simulation”
- “A testbed for GWT-inspired dynamics”
- “A platform for evaluating attention, ignition, and learning tradeoffs”

Avoid language like:
- “Consciousness achieved”
- “Sentience”
- “Subjective experience verified”

## Immediate Next Steps (Evaluation)
1. Measure ignition rate, persistence duration, and broadcast impact.
2. Run baseline experiments and ablations (perception off, reflection off).
3. Track learning retention and consistency across repeated sessions.
