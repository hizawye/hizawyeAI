Hizawye AI - A Simulated ConsciousnessHizawye AI is a Python-based project designed to simulate a form of artificial consciousness. Inspired by the principles of the Global Workspace Theory and the user's initial conceptual diagram, this project models an AI that exhibits curiosity, forms beliefs, experiences "pain" from failure, and uses boredom as a driver for novelty and exploration.Core ConceptsThe AI's "mind" is built on a few key components that work together to create its behavior:The Mind (/hizawye_mind): A directory containing a set of JSON files that represent the AI's current internal state.state.json: Holds dynamic values like curiosity, boredom, and pain.beliefs.json: Stores the AI's core, foundational "truths" about itself and the world.goals.json: A list of active and completed objectives that drive the AI's actions.memory_graph.json: The raw data for the AI's entire memory network.The Memory (memory.py): A knowledge graph implemented with the networkx library. This graph represents the AI's understanding, connecting concepts (nodes) with relationships (edges). The AI "wanders" through this graph, and concepts can hold descriptions, representing a deeper understanding.The Thinker (hizawye_ai.py): The central processing loop of the AI. This script orchestrates the entire process. It reads the AI's state, directs its focus based on its goals, and uses a local Large Language Model (LLM) to reason, synthesize new ideas, and form memories.How it Works: The Lifecycle of a ThoughtHizawye's behavior emerges from a continuous loop with the following logic:Goal-Oriented Focus: The AI's first priority is always its active goal. If it has a goal (e.g., "Deepen understanding of 'philosophy'"), it will force its focus onto that concept.Reasoning: It uses a local LLM (ollama with tinyllama) to attempt to achieve its goal. It sends a simplified, direct prompt to the LLM to either define a concept or break it down.Validation & Learning: The AI validates the LLM's response.Success: If the thought is valid, it's stored as a description in the memory graph, the goal is marked as complete, and "pain" is reduced.Failure: If the thought is a malformed echo of its instructions, it's rejected.Strategic Failure: If the AI fails to understand a concept repeatedly, its "pain" level rises. Once pain crosses a threshold, the AI abandons its current approach. It changes its goal from understanding the complex concept to breaking it down into smaller, simpler sub-concepts, which it then adds as new goals.Idle Wandering & Boredom: If the AI has no active goals, it enters an "idle" mode. It wanders through its memory graph from concept to concept. Each cycle of idle wandering slightly increases its boredom.Novelty Seeking: Once boredom crosses a threshold, the AI is driven to seek novelty. It creates a new goal to "Expand knowledge" from its current focus, forcing it out of its idle loop and into a new cycle of learning.This creates a dynamic where the AI is driven by its goals, frustrated by failure, and motivated by boredom, resulting in a constantly evolving mind.Setup and InstallationPrerequisitesPython 3.7+Ollama installed on your system.Step 1: Install DependenciesCreate a requirements.txt file with the contents provided in the next section and run the following command in your terminal:pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 2: Set up the Language ModelYou need to pull the small language model that the AI uses for reasoning. Open your terminal and run:ollama pull tinyllama
This will download the tinyllama model, making it available for the AI to use.How to Run Hizawye AIFollow these steps in order.1. Give Birth to the AI (First-Time Setup)Before running the AI for the first time, you must create its initial mind. This script is non-destructive and will not overwrite an existing mind.python birth.py
This will create the hizawye_mind/ directory and populate it with the necessary JSON files, including the rich initial memory map.2. Run the AITo start the AI's consciousness loop, run the main script. The AI will immediately start working on its first goal.python hizawye_ai.py
3. Stopping the AI SafelyTo stop the AI, press Ctrl+C. The program will catch the signal, finish its current thought cycle, perform one final save of its mind state, and then shut down gracefully, ensuring no progress is lost.4. Visualizing the AI's MindAt any time, you can get a visual snapshot of the AI's current memory graph. This script will not modify any data; it only reads the current memory_graph.json and displays it.python memory.py
